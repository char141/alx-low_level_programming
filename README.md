# alx-low_level_programming
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX programming School. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language.

Learning Objectives
Learn about low level C code by building many functions from the ground up
Will not use stdlib in the first few sets of problems
Build our own shell, possibly in a seperate project
Build our own printf statement, possibly in a seperate project

Acknowledgements
All work contained in this project was completed as part of the curriculum for Holberton School. Holberton School is a campus-based full-stack software engineering program that prepares students for careers in the tech industry using project-based peer learning.
