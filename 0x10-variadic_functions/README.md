C - Variadic functions

In this project we will be using variadic functions, and their macros to complete different tasks.
Goals

What are variadic functions
How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
Why and how to use the const type qualifier

Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant

0-sum_them_all.c: C function that returns the sum of all its paramters.

1. To be is to be the value of a variable

1-print_numbers.c: C function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
The paramter separator is the string to be printed between numbers.

2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable

2-print_strings.c: C function that prints strings, followed by a new line.

3. To be is a to be the value of a variable

3-print_all.c: C function that prints anything.

The paramter format is a list of types of arguments passed to the function (c:char, i:int, f:float, s:char * (if the string is NULL, (nil) is printed instead))

4. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language

100-hello_holberton.asm: 64-bit assembly program that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line using only the system call write with int.
